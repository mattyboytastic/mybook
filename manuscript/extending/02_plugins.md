# Extending with Plugins

Compared to loaders, plugins are a more flexible means to extend webpack. You have access to webpack's **compiler** and **compilation** processes. It's possible to run child compilers and plugins can work in tandem with loaders as `ExtractTextPlugin` shows.

Plugins allow you to intercept webpack's execution through hooks. Webpack itself has been implemented as a collection of plugins. Underneath it relies on [tapable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tapable) plugin interface that allows webpack to apply plugins in different ways.

You learn to develop a couple of small plugins next. Unlike for loaders, there is no separate environment where you can run them so they have to be run against webpack itself. It's possible to push smaller logic outside of the webpack facing portion, though, as this allows you to unit test it in isolation.

## The Basic Flow of Webpack Plugins

A webpack plugin is expected to expose an `apply(compiler)` method. JavaScript allows multiple ways to do this. You could use a function and then attach methods to its `prototype`. To follow the newest syntax, you could use a `class` to model the same idea.

Regardless of your approach, you should capture possible options passed by a user at the constructor. It's a good idea to declare a schema to communicate them to the user. [schema-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/schema-utils) allows validation and works with loaders too.

When the plugin is connected to webpack configuration, webpack will run its constructor and call `apply` with a compiler object passed to it. The object exposes webpack's plugin API and allows you to use its hooks as listed by [the official compiler reference](https://webpack.js.org/api/plugins/compiler/).

T> [webpack-defaults](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-defaults) works as a starting point for webpack plugins. It contains the infrastructure used to develop official webpack loaders and plugins.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

Since plugins have to be run against webpack, you have to set up one to run a demo plugin that will be developed further:

**webpack.plugin.js**

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const DemoPlugin = require('./plugins/demo-plugin.js');

const PATHS = {
  lib: path.join(__dirname, 'lib'),
  build: path.join(__dirname, 'build'),
};

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    lib: PATHS.lib,
  },
  output: {
    path: PATHS.build,
    filename: '[name].js',
  },
  plugins: [
    new DemoPlugin(),
  ],
};
```

T> If you don't have a `lib` entry file set up yet, write one. The contents don't matter as long as it's JavaScript that webpack can parse.

To make it convenient to run, set up a build shortcut:

**package.json**

```json
"scripts": {
leanpub-start-insert
  "build:plugin": "webpack --config webpack.plugin.js",
leanpub-end-insert
  ...
},
```

Executing either should result in an `Error: Cannot find module` failure as the actual plugin is still missing.

T> If you want an interactive development environment, consider setting up [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) against the build. Webpack's own watcher won't work in this particular case as you have to restart the whole webpack process once you detect a change.

## Implementing a Basic Plugin

The simplest plugin should do two things: capture options and provide `apply` method:

**plugins/demo-plugin.js**

```javascript
module.exports = class DemoPlugin {
  apply() {
    console.log('applying ');
  }
};
```

If you run the plugin (`npm run build:plugin`), you should see `applying` message at console. Given most plugins accept options, it's a good idea to capture those and pass them to `apply`.

## Capturing Options

Options can be captured through a `constructor`:

**plugins/demo-plugin.js**

```javascript
module.exports = class DemoPlugin {
  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options;
  }
  apply() {
    console.log(`apply ${JSON.stringify(this.options)}`);
  }
};
```

Running the plugin (`npm run build:plugin`) now would result in `apply undefined` kind of message given no options were passed. Adjust the configuration to pass an option:

**webpack.plugin.js**

```javascript
...

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
leanpub-start-delete
    new DemoPlugin(),
leanpub-end-delete
leanpub-start-insert
    new DemoPlugin({ name: 'demo' }),
leanpub-end-insert
  ],
};
```

Now you should see `apply {"name":"demo"}` after running (`npm run build:plugin`).

## Understanding Compiler and Compilation

`apply` receives webpack's compiler as a parameter. Printing reveals more:

**plugins/demo-plugin.js**

```javascript
module.exports = class DemoPlugin {
  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options;
  }
  apply(compiler) {
    console.log(compiler);
  }
};
```

After running (`npm run build:plugin`), you should see a lot of data. Especially `options` should look familiar as it contains webpack configuration. You can also see familiar names like `records`.

If you go through webpack's [plugin development documentation](https://webpack.js.org/api/plugins/), you'll see a compiler provides a large amount of hooks. Each hook corresponds with a specific stage. For example, to emit files, you could listen to the `emit` event and then write.

Adjust the implementation to listen and capture `compilation`:

**plugins/demo-plugin.js**

```javascript
module.exports = class DemoPlugin {
  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options;
  }
  apply(compiler) {
leanpub-start-delete
    console.log(compiler);
leanpub-end-delete
leanpub-start-insert
    compiler.plugin('emit', (compilation, cb) => {
      console.log(compilation);

      cb();
    });
leanpub-end-insert
  }
};
```

W> Forgetting the callback and running the plugin makes webpack fail silently!

Running the build (`npm run build:plugin`) should show more information than before. This is because a compilation object contains whole dependency graph traversed by webpack. You have access to everything related to it here including entries, chunks, modules, assets, and more.

T> Many of the available hooks expose compilation, but sometimes they expose a more specific structure and it takes more specific study to understand those.

T> Loaders have a dirty access to `compiler` and `compilation` through underscore (`this._compiler`/`this._compilation`).

## Writing Files Through Compilation

The `assets` object of compilation can be used for writing new files. You can also capture already created assets, manipulate them, and write them back.

To write an asset, you have to use [webpack-sources](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-sources) file abstraction. Install it first:

```bash
npm install webpack-sources --save-dev
```

Adjust the code as follows to write through `RawSource`:

**plugins/demo-plugin.js**

```javascript
const { RawSource } = require('webpack-sources');

module.exports = class DemoPlugin {
  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options;
  }
  apply(compiler) {
leanpub-start-insert
    const { name } = this.options;
leanpub-end-insert

    compiler.plugin('emit', (compilation, cb) => {
leanpub-start-delete
      console.log(compilation);
leanpub-end-delete
leanpub-start-insert
      compilation.assets[name] = new RawSource('demo');
leanpub-end-insert

      cb();
    });
  }
};
```

After building (`npm run build:plugin`), you should see output like this:

```bash
Hash: 62abc7fe06a7360b9735
Version: webpack 2.2.1
Time: 58ms
 Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
lib.js  2.89 kB       0  [emitted]  lib
  demo  4 bytes          [emitted]
   [0] ./lib/index.js 49 bytes {0} [built]
```

If you examine *build/demo* file, you'll see it contains the word *demo* as per code above.

T> Compilation has a set of hooks of its own as covered in [the official compilation reference](https://webpack.js.org/api/plugins/compiler/).

## Managing Warnings and Errors

Plugin execution can be caused to fail by throwing an error (`throw new Error('Message')`). If you validate options, you can use this method.

In case you want to give the user a warning or an error message during compilation, you should use `compilation.warnings` and `compilation.errors`. Example:

```javascript
compilation.warnings.push('warning');
compilation.warnings.push('error');
```

There is no way pass information messages to webpack yet although there is [a logging proposal](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/3996). If you want to use `console.log` for this purpose, push it behind a `verbose` flag. The problem is that `console.log` will print to stdout and it will end up in webpack's `--json` output as a result. A flag will allow the user to work around this problem.

## Plugins Can Have Plugins

Sometimes it can make sense for a plugin to provide hooks of its own. This way you can write plugins for plugins to extend their functionality. [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) is a good example of that. Example plugins are discussed in detail in the *Getting Started* chapter.

## Plugins Can Run Compilers of Their Own

In special cases, like [offline-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/offline-plugin), it makes sense to run a child compiler. This gives full control over related entries and output. Arthur Stolyar, the author of the plugin has explained [the idea of child compilers at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38276028/webpack-child-compiler-change-configuration).

## Conclusion

Writing webpack plugins can be challenging at first due to the sheer size of the API webpack provides and it's the most powerful way you can extend webpack, though. When you begin to design a plugin, it's a good idea to spend time studying existing plugins that are close enough to what you are going to implement as this can generate insight on which hooks you should use and how.

It's a good idea to develop a plugin piece-wise so that you validate one piece of it at a time. The ultimate approach for understanding webpack plugins in great detail is to delve into webpack source itself as it's a big collection of plugins.

To recap:

* **Plugins** can intercept webpack's execution and extend it making them more flexible than loaders.
* Plugins can be combined with loaders. `ExtractTextPlugin` is a good example of a plugin that works this way. In that case, loaders are used to mark assets to extract.
* Plugins have access to webpack's **compiler** and **compilation** processes. Both provide hooks for different stages of webpack's execution flow and allow you to manipulate it. This is how webpack itself works.
* Plugins can emit new assets and shape existing assets.
* Plugins can implement plugin systems of their own. `HtmlWebpackPlugin` is an example of a such plugin.
* Plugins can run compilers of their own. The isolation gives more control and allows plugins like *offline-plugin* to be written.
