# Setting Environment Variables

Sometimes a part of your code should execute only during development. Or you could have experimental features in your build that are not ready for production yet. This code should not end up in the production build.

As JavaScript minifiers can remove dead code (`if (false)`), you can build on top of this idea and write code that gets transformed into this form. Webpack's `DefinePlugin` enables replacing **free variables** so that you can convert `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')` kind of code to `if (true)` or `if (false)` depending on the environment.

You can find packages that rely on this behavior. React is perhaps the most known example of an early adopter of the technique. Using `DefinePlugin` can bring down the size of your React production build somewhat as a result, and you can see a similar effect with other packages as well.

## The Basic Idea of `DefinePlugin`

To understand the idea of `DefinePlugin` better, consider the example below:

```javascript
var foo;

// Not free due to "foo" above, not ok to replace
if (foo === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}

// Free since you don't refer to "bar", ok to replace
if (bar === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}
```

If you replaced `bar` with a string like `'foobar'`, then you would end up with code like this:

```javascript
var foo;

// Not free due to "foo" above, not ok to replace
if (foo === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}

// Free since you don't refer to "bar", ok to replace
if ('foobar' === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}
```

Further analysis shows that `'foobar' === 'bar'` equals `false` so a minifier gives the following:

```javascript
var foo;

// Not free due to "foo" above, not ok to replace
if (foo === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}

// Free since you don't refer to "bar", ok to replace
if (false) {
  console.log('bar');
}
```

And based on this a minifier can eliminate the `if` statement as it has become dead code:

```javascript
var foo;

// Not free, not ok to replace
if (foo === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}

// if (false) means the block can be dropped entirely
```

Elimination is the core idea of `DefinePlugin`. You can toggle parts of code using this kind of mechanism. A good minifier can perform the analysis and enable/disable entire portions of the code as you prefer.

## Setting `process.env.NODE_ENV`

Given you are using React in the project and it happens to use the technique, you can try to enable `DefinePlugin` and see what it does to the production build.

As before, encapsulate this idea to a function. Due to the way webpack replaces the free variable, you should push it through `JSON.stringify`. You end up with a string like `'"demo"'` and then webpack inserts that into the slots it finds.

**webpack.parts.js**

```javascript
...

exports.setFreeVariable = (key, value) => {
  const env = {};
  env[key] = JSON.stringify(value);

  return {
    plugins: [
      new webpack.DefinePlugin(env),
    ],
  };
};
```

You can connect this with the configuration like this:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...

const productionConfig = merge([
  ...
leanpub-start-insert
  parts.setFreeVariable(
    'process.env.NODE_ENV',
    'production'
  ),
leanpub-end-insert
]);

...
```

Execute `npm run build` and you should see improved results:

```bash
Hash: fe11f4781275080dd01a
Version: webpack 2.2.1
Time: 4726ms
        Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names

     0.js.map    2.07 kB       0  [emitted]
   app.js.map    2.32 kB       1  [emitted]  app
  app.css.map   84 bytes       1  [emitted]  app
vendor.js.map     135 kB       2  [emitted]  vendor
   index.html  274 bytes          [emitted]
   [4] ./~/object-assign/index.js 2.11 kB {2} [built]
  [14] ./app/component.js 461 bytes {1} [built]
  [15] ./app/shake.js 138 bytes {1} [built]
...
```

You went from 150 kB to 45 kB, and finally, to 24 kB. The final build is faster than the previous one as well.

Given the 24 kB can be served gzipped, it's somewhat reasonable. gzipping drops around another 40%, and it's well supported by browsers.

T> `webpack.EnvironmentPlugin(['NODE_ENV'])` is a shortcut that allows you to refer to environment variables. It uses `DefinePlugin` underneath and you can achieve the same effect by passing `process.env.NODE_ENV` to the custom function you made. The [documentation covers `EnvironmentPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/) in greater detail.

## Replacing Free Variables Through Babel

[babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables) Babel plugin can be used to achieve the same effect. See [the official documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-inline-environment-variables/) for details.

[babel-plugin-transform-define](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-define) and [babel-plugin-minify-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-minify-replace) are other alternatives for Babel.

## Choosing Which Module to Use Based on the Environment

The techniques discussed in this chapter can be used to choose entire modules depending on the environment. As seen above, `DefinePlugin` based splitting allows you to choose which branch of code to use and which to discard. This idea can be used to implement branching on module level. Consider the file structure below:

```bash
.
└── store
    ├── index.js
    ├── store.dev.js
    └── store.prod.js
```

The idea is that you choose either `dev` or `prod` version of the store depending on the environment. It's that *index.js* which does the hard work like this:

```javascript
if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  module.exports = require('./store.prod');
} else {
  module.exports = require('./store.dev');
}
```

Webpack can pick the right code based on the `DefinePlugin` declaration and this code. You have to use CommonJS module definition style here as ES6 `import`s don't allow dynamic behavior by design.

T> A related technique, **aliasing**, is discussed in the *Consuming Packages* chapter. You could alias to development or production particular file depending on the environment. The problem is that it ties your setup to webpack in a tighter way than the solution above.

## Webpack Optimization Plugins

Webpack includes a collection of optimization related plugins:

* [compression-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression-webpack-plugin) allows you to push the problem of generating compressed files to webpack to potentially save processing time on the server.
* `webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin` allows you to minify output using different heuristics. Certain of them break code unless you are careful.
* `webpack.optimize.AggressiveSplittingPlugin` allows you to split code into smaller bundles as discussed in the *Splitting Bundles* chapter. The result is ideal for a HTTP/2 environment.
* `webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin` makes it possible to extract common dependencies into bundles of their own.
* `webpack.DefinePlugin` allows you to use feature flags in your code and eliminate the redundant code as discussed in this chapter.
* [lodash-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-webpack-plugin) creates smaller Lodash builds by replacing feature sets with smaller alternatives leading to more compact builds.

## Conclusion

Setting environment variables is a technique that allows you to control which paths of the source are included in the build. The process enables production specific optimizations and feature flags.

To recap:

* Webpack allows you to set environment variables through `DefinePlugin` and `EnvironmentPlugin`. Latter is a wrapper for `DefinePlugin` that maps system level environment variables to the source.
* `DefinePlugin` operates based on **free variables** and it replaces them as webpack analyzes the source code.
* You can achieve similar results by using Babel plugins.
* Given minifiers eliminate dead code, using the plugins allows you to remove the code from the resulting build.
* The plugins enable module level patterns. By implementing a wrapper, you can choose which file webpack includes to the resulting build.
* In addition to these plugins, you can find other optimization related plugins that allow you to control the build result in many ways.

To ensure the build has good cache invalidation behavior, you learn to include hashes to the generated filenames in the next chapter. This way the client notices if assets have changed and can fetch the updated versions.
